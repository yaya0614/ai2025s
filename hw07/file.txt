 Before YouTube I started three side hustles and they all failed miserably.  And

then I started YouTube as a bit of an experiment.  I made videos for one and a

half years straight without earning a single penny.  But 47 videos later

everything changed with one viral video.  During these 18 months there were many

moments where I felt like giving up  and when my videos were only getting 30

views,  I thought this would be my fourth failure in a row.  But there was one

framework which changed my entire

perspective  and kept me going despite me seeing little to no results.  When we

set out on any new endeavor, whether that's a startup, a side hustle or a

relationship,  we all go through the emotional cycle of change.  We start with

uninformed optimism.  The highlight reel of others makes us believe that success

is inevitable if we just stay consistent.  But as time passes we realize that

things are not as easy as we originally thought.  And informed pessimism slowly

creeps in.  We encounter challenges and

setbacks that we originally overlooked during the honeymoon period.  And

eventually we reach the valley of despair,  where despite all our efforts

nothing seems to work.  And it's usually at this stage where most people burn

out and give up.  Whilst laying in this valley we'll notice a new trend, a new

idea, a new person,  leading us to repeat this cycle all over again and majority

of us live life in this continuous loop,  jumping from one idea to the next and

one relationship to another.  Just as quickly

as we scroll through reels we quit and move on,  using the first sign of burnout

as our excuse to chase the next big thing.  And for the longest time I was stuck

in this loop chasing one idea to the next  and one business model to another.

But as soon as I understood the following principle I was able to break free

from this cycle.  To break free from this cycle choose your pursuit based on the

sacrifice you're willing to tolerate,  not the so-called success you've been

promised.  If you inherently enjoy

what you do then you'll be able to push through the lows  and escape this cycle

to reach informed optimism,  where you truly understand what's required to

attain mastery and success in your chosen pursuit.  So it's important to pick

wisely from the onset.  Pick something where the reward feels worth the

sacrifice, as they say,  is the juice worth the squeeze?  But if the juice is

only monetary then burnout isn't a question of if, it's a question of when.  And

this exactly was the case for me before YouTube.

My choices were purely based on monetary reasons,  not because I genuinely

enjoyed or was interested in those things.  So as soon as I experienced a period

of dip I would burn out, quit and move on to the next thing.  As Seth Godin

explains,  it's the dip which separates the best from the rest.  It weeds out

the winners from the losers.  Real winners know when to quit and losers quit on

almost everything.  So if you pick something you don't care about then chances

are you'll stay stuck in this dip  and

bounce around different ideas without ever making any meaningful progress.  As

paradoxical as it sounds, the best way to serve your audience is to not think

about them.  Instead pick something which scratches your own itch or solves your

own problem.  Because now you're no longer doing it for external validation,

you're doing it for yourself.  It's like the actor who's no longer acting,

they've become the character.  Once you're in this space, you'll be ready to

camp a fire in the valley of despair  and no

amount of wind will be able to burn you out or force you to quit.  As burnout

doesn't come from doing more work, it comes from doing work you don't inherently

enjoy.  So pick wisely from the onset and be ready for the journey ahead because

the dip is inevitable.  If you want to know more about my previous three failed
